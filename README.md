10 questions are selected at random from a group of 36 questions. Every time the web page is reloaded, a new set of 10 questions show up on screen. The responses are sent to the backend on form submission, and stored in a MongoDB collection. The stored data is then retrieved from the database and used to populate a .csv file ('data.csv').
